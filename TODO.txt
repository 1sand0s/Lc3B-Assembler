 + Remove comments from self-explanatory code blocks

 + Simplify ode by relegating only the control flow for handling errors into branches keeping main flow outside

 + Unrelated error checks should have separate branches (check goto style error handling)

 + Place more descriptive comments in function block rather than in code

 + Reduce commenting by making code self-explanatory/self-documenting
   +Isolate blocks of code into self describing named functions
   +Isolation of code into functions makes unit testing easier and more effective
   +Reduces coupling between unrelated code
   +Makes it reusable across functions
 
 - [DONE] Xmacro for keeping function pointers in sync with enum pFSM states

 + Modular print/log function with levels

 - [DONE] Const correctness for improved readability

 + Appropriate usage of signed and unsigned integers
